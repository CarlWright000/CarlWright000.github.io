                        A little about us!
                    </H4>
                    <p>
                        We started out as a trio of brothers out of their parents basements and a single printer,
                        and a love for Tabletop games. as we got further into our passions our friends started asking
                        about obtaining some models for them selfs. We said "Why not!" and started printing.
                        It spiraled out of control from there, friends told friends and over time we started getting
                        people we never heard of, asking about getting one of our models. we set a price and the rest
                        was
                        history.
